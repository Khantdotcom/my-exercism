1. JavaScript (Jan 6 – Jan 16)
Total Exercises: 137

Time Required: ~46 hours

Daily Commitment: ~4.2 hours/day

Verdict: Feasible. This is like a part-time job. It’s intense, but very doable if you are focused.

2. C++ (Jan 6 – Jan 31)
Total Exercises: 90

Time Required: ~30 hours

Daily Commitment: ~1.1 hours/day

Verdict: Very Feasible. Doing an hour of C++ alongside your JS/TS work is a great way to keep your "low-level" programming muscles active without burning out.

3. TypeScript (Jan 17 – Jan 26)
Total Exercises: 100

Time Required: ~33 hours

Daily Commitment: ~3.3 hours/day

Verdict: Highly Feasible. Since you will have just finished the JavaScript track, you will find that many TypeScript exercises are nearly identical in logic. You will likely fly through these much faster than 20 minutes each.

4. Python (Feb 9 – Feb 28)
Total Exercises: 140

Time Required: ~47 hours

Daily Commitment: ~2.3 hours/day

Verdict: Very Feasible. You have 20 days to finish, which allows for a steady, relaxed pace.
